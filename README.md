# TindaLog â€” Backend

This folder contains the separated backend for the TindaLog mobile/web application. It's a small Express-based Node.js service that provides API endpoints used by the TindaLog app(s).

Contents

- Minimal Express app (entry: `index.js`)
- package.json with the project's metadata and dependencies

Goals

- Provide a lightweight REST API for the TindaLog client(s)
- Keep the backend simple so it can be extended with authentication, database, and other services later

Quickstart (local)

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

3. The server will start on the port printed to the console (default: 3000 if the app uses that). Open your client app and configure it to talk to `http://localhost:<port>`.

Notes about package.json

- The project currently depends on `express` (see `package.json`).
- There are no build steps or tests configured by default.

Recommended development additions

- Add a proper start script and a development script to `package.json`:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
  	"start": "node index.js",
  	"dev": "nodemon index.js",
  	"test": "jest"
  }
  ```

- Add basic environment configuration (see Environment variables).
- Add a simple logger (morgan/winston) and error handling middleware.

Environment variables

The project doesn't currently include an `.env` but you should add one for local development. Example variables:

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/tindalog
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
```

API surface (examples)

Below are example endpoints you might expect in the TindaLog backend. Replace or extend based on actual implementation.

- GET /health

  - Returns 200 OK with a small JSON object to indicate the server is running.

- POST /auth/login

  - Body: { email, password }
  - Returns: { token, user }

- POST /auth/signup

  - Body: { name, email, password }
  - Returns: { user }

- GET /customers

  - Returns a paginated list of customers for the authenticated user.

- POST /transactions
  - Create a new transaction (purchase, payment, etc.)

Testing

- Add unit and integration tests with Jest or Mocha. Example to run tests (after adding tests):

```bash
npm test
```

Deployment and hosting notes

- The backend can be hosted on any Node.js friendly platform (Heroku, Render, Vercel Serverless Functions, Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, DigitalOcean App Platform).
- Make sure to set environment variables on the host and use a managed database for production.

Security and production readiness checklist

- Move secrets to environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Ensure CORS is configured to only allow trusted origins.
- Add rate limiting, request validation, and authentication (JWT or sessions).
- Add logging and monitoring (Sentry, Prometheus + Grafana, etc.).

Contributing

If you'd like to help improve the backend:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch per feature.
2. Add tests for new behavior.
3. Open a pull request and describe your changes.

License

---

If you want, I can also:

- Add starter scripts to `package.json` (`start`, `dev`).
- Create a minimal `index.js` or `src/server.js` with an Express app and a `/health` endpoint.
- Add a `.env.example` and a basic `.gitignore` for node.

Tell me which of these you'd like and I'll implement them.
